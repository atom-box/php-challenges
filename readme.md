# PHP Challenges
## From the book: PHP, MySQL, & JavaScript by Robin Nixon
I am trying the MySQL syntax from the 2009 edition of this OReilly book.  Robin invented the browser pop up window.  The book 
pre-dates PHP 5.  So far the main difference has been that mysqli should replace all instances of the deprecated MYSQL php functions.
## From the book PHP 7 Solutions by David Powers
This book was published in 2019 so I am trying out the PHP v7 syntax:
* null coalescing operators
## From various online challenges
I am solving short challenges, e.g. [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/java) from Stanford University.<br />
The INCLUDES folder has most of the active development.
