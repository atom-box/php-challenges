# PHP Challenges from here:

* __PHP 7 Solutions__ by David Powers.  Clear writing. Up to date with PHP 7.
* [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/java) from Stanford University. Free! Online. Lightweight interface -- no registration needed unless you want to track your progress.
 * __PHP, MySQL, & JavaScript__ by Robin Nixon 2009, OReilly. Good pedagogically but out of date and very non OOP. Fun fact: Robin Nixon invented the browser pop up window.
